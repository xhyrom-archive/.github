Organization for [xHyroM](https://github.com/xHyroM)'s archived repos

Don't forget that an archived repository does not mean a broken repository. A lot of repositories are archived because I don't see any reason to add anymore, and because I don't feel like it and they need a complete rewrite, but I think it's pointless.
